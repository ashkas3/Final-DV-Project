Final Data Visualization project - Women's Wellbeing

Team members - Sumairha Mumtaz Choudhary, Ashka Shah, Carissa Chou

Abstract -
Globally, one in three women have been subjected to physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence, non partner sexual violence, or both at least once in their life. On average, women are paid 24% less than men for comparable work, across all regions and sectors. Moreover, nearly two thirds of the worldâ€™s 781 million illiterate adults are women, a proportion that has remained unchanged for two decades. (link)

Everyday, women across the globe, in each country are confronted by discrimination and injustice. They face abuse, violence and unequal treatment at homes, workplace and in their communities. They are denied opportunities to learn, earn or grow. Gendered discrimination is prevalent across the world, but women in some parts of the world are more vulnerable compared to others. 
Our project is an attempt to understand which countries are better for women and which are not. Through this project we try to find out reasons why some countries are better for women's well-being compared to others and how conflict and a nation's Gross National Income (GNI) per capita impact women's wellbeing.

Work split - 
All members of our team come from a non-CS background. However, we split the work keeping in mind our strengths as individuals for this project. 

Sumairha, coming from a design background with an interest in research did the end-to-end research for this project (data sources, evidence for narrative, etc.), designed the final presentation/website and made the demo video.
Ashka, with a background in analytics and some beginner level coding experience, performed EDAs and cleaned the datasets, built the visualizations in python and coded/styled the webapp hosted in Github using HTML/CSS (using PyScript for python code block).
Carissa, with a design background and research experience, worked on choosing the visualizations, designing the presentation and writing the research paper for our project.

We all worked and brainstormed together to decide the story and flow of our project.
