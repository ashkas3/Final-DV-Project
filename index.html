                    Globally, one in three women have been subjected to physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence, non partner sexual violence, or both at least once in their life. On average, women are paid 24% less than men for comparable work, across all regions and sectors. Moreover, nearly two thirds of the world’s 781 million illiterate adults are women, a proportion that has remained unchanged for two decades. <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/what-we-do/issues/gender-justice-and-womens-rights">(link)</a>
                    <br><br>
                    Everyday, women across the globe, in each country are confronted by discrimination and injustice. They face abuse, violence and unequal treatment at homes, workplace and in their communities. They are denied opportunities to learn, earn or grow. Gendered discrimination is prevalent across the world, but women in some parts of the world are more vulnerable compared to others. Our project is an attempt to understand which countries are better for women and which are not. We will also find out reasons why some countries are better for women's well-being compared to others.

                <p class="lead">
                    To measure well-being across the world, we analyzed two parameters- Human Development Index and Women’s Peace and Security Index. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Human Development Index (HDI) is dataset that measures development in a country by using  key parameters of human development: long and healthy life, having a decent life and being educated. The health parameter is measured by the life expectancy at birth, education is measured by mean education years of schooling for adults ages 25 and above. The detailed parameters and data set can be accessed <a href="https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI">here</a>.
                    <br><br>.
                    <br><br>
                    The Women’s Peace and Security (WPS) Index measures women’s inclusion, justice, and security for countries across the world. It ranks countries on 11 parameters.  Countries with higher WPS Index are better suited for women. The detailed parameters and data set can be accessed <a href="https://giwps.georgetown.edu/the-index/">here</a>.
                    <br><br>
                    After comparing the countries in both the data-set, we could see disparity in how the countries performed. We noticed that most countries that were in the top quartile in HDI were also in the top quartile in WPS. However, as we moved down the HDI rankings, we noticed that countries were doing good in their HDI ranking but their WPS rank was relatively low.

                        Education is critical to women’s opportunities. From the visualization we can see that the same countries that scored high on the overall WPS index score also scores high in education. The country with the highest years of education is Germany with 13.9 years of education completed, and the lowest is Burkina Faso with only 1.1 years of education.
                        <br> <br>
                        However, the trend is different for employment. Employment reflects women’s economic opportunities, which are central to realizing women’s capabilities. Interestingly, the relationship almost seems inverted, and the country with the highest female labor force participation is Burundi at 91.8%.

                        A region-based relationship became evident. Countries in South Asia, Middle East and Africa are doing poorly on education, have higher legal discrimination, have higher intimate partner violence and lower perception of community safety. Countries in Europe, North America and Oceania were doing good across all parameters. We chose a hue-based map to make the visualization accessible to color-blind.

                        <b>The WPS Index is although measuring well being of countries, it does not give a reason why some countries are doing better than others in these parameters.</b> We we curious about the reasons for the disparity across countries and after analyzing the data, we concluded two broad factors that seem to be common for countries with low WPS Index:
                        <br><br>
                        A) Countries which have had a history of conflict seemed to be doing poorly on the WPS scale. Countries in South Asia, Middle East and Africa have a history of long and recurring conflict which are also the countries that are in the lower quartile of WPS.
                        <br><br>
                        B) Developed countries were generally speaking doing well on the WPS Index. After looking at various measures of development of a country like life expectancy, years of schooling, Gross Domestic Income etc we noticed a strong correlation

                    To analyze conflict, we referred to the PRIO Conflict Recurrence Database. The data base includes all violent event related to a conflict, rather than relying on the commonly used 25-death threshold. The conflict is counted as recurring when there is at least one calendar year between the last event in the previous episode, and the first event in the following episode while the WPS only tracks data from one year. The data can be accessed <a href="https://www.prio.org/data/31">here</a>. 
                    <br><br>
                    Although the WPS index has one indicator that already analyzes violence– however it is for specifically organized violence deaths. So the WPS index only tracks the total number of battle deaths from state-based, non-state, and one-sided conflicts per 100,000 people. We wanted to see how sustained, recurring conflict over the years  impacts women so we plotted the WPS Index against years of conflict for all countries.

                        One of our team mates is from Kashmir, the most militarized zone in the world, so we were curious to look into this relationship. Conflict effects women in insidious way. The ongoing conflict in Kashmir has worsened the mental well being of women. The effect of conflict on the mental health of women is more compared to men. Studies have found that 50% of women suffered from probable depression compared to 37% men, 36% of women compared to 21% of men had a probable anxiety disorder; and 22% of women compared to 18% of men suffered from probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). You can read more about the mental health implication of conflict in Kashmir <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/my-thoughts-will-kill-me-one-day-mental-health-crisis-for-kashmiri-women/">here</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        The other outcome of conflict is domestic violence. The lack of opportunities and the state of conflict effects the mental-health of men which can lead to increased violence against women. The conflict in Kashmir increased after 2019 after the abrogation of article 370. In 2019, the helpline received 55 calls, but in 2020, 177 calls came through. However, those numbers have increased further over the last three months, with over 120 distress calls made by women seeking help during this time. You can read about the increase in cases of domestic violence from conflict <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/kashmir-the-link-between-armed-conflict-and-domestic-violence/a-57268013">here</a>.

                        What was interesting that countries with same conflict years, the WPS Index differed. Even at 0 conflict years first-world countries like Canada and those in western Europe score higher than countries like Brazil and Mauritania. For example, South Sudan, Chad, Libya, Spain and Yemen have the same conflict years but the WPS Index for them varies. This lead us to our second factor- Gross Domestic Income.

                        We went through some articles and research papers and found out that countries with less GNI had less economic opportunities for both men and women. The lack of opportunities has an impact on women's well-being in multiple ways.

                        We found research that showed that  job loss triggers two mechanisms—income loss, and an increase in potential time at home. The loss of income creates stress within the household, while more time at home increases exposure to the risk of domestic violence. <a href="=https://phys.org/news/2021-10-unemployment-substantially-domestic-violence.html">(link)</a>

                        Essentially less Gross National Income means less jobs and more time spent at home which creates stress within a household and increases exposure to domestic violence. Something that was evident during the rise of COVID.

                        By plotting all the datasets- WPS Index, conflict duration and Gross National Income on one visualization, the relationship between the parameters became evident. All countries towards right had lesser conflict years, high gross national income and higher WPS score. These were countries in Europe and America.

                    The average conflict years for countries in the middle range is about thirty years, as we move towards higher GNI and WPS, the size of the country reduces, showing a reduction in conflict years. Countries towards the upper right like Norway, Finland, Iceland, Denmark and the best places for women well being because of less conflict and higher GNI.
                    <br><br>
                    Countries like Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, Pakistan and Iraq are the worst for women's well being owing to their long history of conflict and low GNI.
                    <br><br>
                    An interesting observation was that more than 90% of countries that were in top percentile of WPS were also in the top percentile of GNI Index. And 87.5% of the countries which had lower WPS index had a history of recurring conflict. This strong correlation validated our assumption. There are multiple reasons that contribute to women’s well-being in a nation but through our exploration we concluded that Income and conflict in a country have a strong correlation with women's well-being in the country.

The insidious effect of long term conflict on women also needs to be acknowledged and countries need to take active initiates to mitigate the impact conflict has on women's well being.</b>
